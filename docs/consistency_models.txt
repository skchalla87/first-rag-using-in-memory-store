Consistency models define the rules for how operations on data objects appear to different processes in a distributed system.

1. Strong Consistency:
After an update completes, any subsequent access will return the updated value. This is the hardest to achieve in distributed systems but the easiest for developers to reason about.

2. Eventual Consistency:
If no new updates are made to a given data item, eventually all accesses to that item will return the last updated value. This model is highly available and used in systems like DNS and Amazon's Dynamo.

3. Causal Consistency:
Ensures that operations that are causally related are seen by every node in the same order. Operations that are not causally related are considered concurrent.

4. Read-Your-Writes Consistency:
A process that has updated a data item will always see the updated value and never an older value.
